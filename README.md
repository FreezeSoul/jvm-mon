# jvm-mon

Console based JVM monitoring - when you just want to SSH into a server and see what's going on.

jvm-top lets you monitor your JVM server applications from the terminal.

# New Version

Release: [1.3](https://github.com/ajermakovics/jvm-mon/releases/tag/1.3)
- Rewritten in Go 
- Single executable file
- Can monitor applications on Java 8 and above
- Does not require an existing JDK

How it works:
 - jvm-mon executable comes bundled with a Java agent jar
 - On startup it extracts the agent to a temp directory
 - It attaches to the JVM you want to monitor
 - Loads agent into running JVM to collect metrics
 - Agent and app establish a socket connection to send metrics
